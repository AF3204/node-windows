Please note that like all\nWindows services, creating one requires administrative privileges. To create a service with\nnode-windows, prepare a script like:</p>\n\n<pre><code>var Service = require('node-windows').Service;\n\n// Create a new service object\nvar svc = new Service({\n  name:'Hello World',\n  description: 'The nodejs.org example web server.',\n  script: 'C:\\\\path\\\\to\\\\helloworld.js')\n});\n\n// Listen for the \"install\" event, which indicates the\n// process is available as a service.\nsvc.on('install',function(){\n  svc.start();\n});\n\nsvc.install();\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The code above creates a new <code>Service</code> object, providing a pretty name and description.\nThe <code>script</code> attribute identifies the Node.js script that should run as a service. Upon running\nthis, the script will be visible from the Windows Services utility.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://raw.github.com/coreybutler/node-windows/master/docs/service.png\" alt=\"Windows Service\" /></p>\n\n<p>The <code>Service</code> object emits the following events:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><em>install</em> - Fired when the script is installed as a service.</li>\n<li><em>alreadyinstalled</em> - Fired if the script is already known to be a service.</li>\n<li><em>invalidinstallation</em> - Fired if an installation is detected but missing required files.</li>\n<li><em>uninstall</em> - Fired when an uninstallation is complete.</li>\n<li><em>start</em> - Fired when the new service is started.</li>\n<li><em>stop</em> - Fired when the service is stopped.</li>\n<li><em>error</em> - Fired in some instances when an error occurs.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<p>In the example above, the script listens for the <code>install</code> event. Since this event\nis fired when a service installation is complete, it is safe to start the service.</p>\n\n<p>Services created by node-windows are similar to most other services running on Windows.\nThey can be started/stopped from the windows service utility, via <code>NET START</code> or <code>NET STOP</code> commands,\nor even managed using the <a href=\"http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd228922(v=ws.10).aspx\">sc</a>\nutility.</p>\n\n<h2 id='nodeWindowsService-section-1'>Environment Variables</h2>\n\n<p>Sometimes you may want to provide a service with static data, passed in on creation of the service. You can do this by setting environment variables in the service config, as shown below:</p>\n\n<pre><code>var svc = new Service({\n  name:'Hello World',\n  description: 'The nodejs.org example web server.',\n  script: 'C:\\\\path\\\\to\\\\helloworld.js',\n  env: {\n    name: \"HOME\",\n    value: process.env[\"USERPROFILE\"] // service is now able to access the user who created its' home directory\n  }\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>You can also supply an array to set multiple environment variables:</p>\n\n<pre><code>var svc = new Service({\n  name:'Hello World',\n  description: 'The nodejs.org example web server.',\n  script: 'C:\\\\path\\\\to\\\\helloworld.js',\n  env: [{\n    name: \"HOME\",\n    value: process.env[\"USERPROFILE\"] // service is now able to access the user who created its' home directory\n  },\n  {\n    name: \"TEMP\",\n    value: path.join(process.env[\"USERPROFILE\"],\"/temp\") // use a temp directory in user's home directory\n  }]\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<h2 id='nodeWindowsService-section-2'>User Account Attributes</h2>\n\n<p>If you need to specify a specific user or particular credentials to manage a service, the following\nattributes may be helpful.</p>\n\n<p>The <code>user</code> attribute is an object with three keys: <code>domain</code>,<code>account</code>, and <code>password</code>.\nThis can be used to identify which user the service library should use to perform system commands.\nBy default, the domain is set to the local computer name, but it can be overridden with an Active Directory\nor LDAP domain. For example:</p>\n\n<p><strong>app.js</strong></p>\n\n<pre><code>var Service = require('node-windows').Service;\n\n// Create a new service object\nvar svc = new Service({\n  name:'Hello World',\n  script: require('path').join(__dirname,'helloworld.js')\n});\n\nsvc.user.domain = 'mydomain.local';\nsvc.user.account = 'username';\nsvc.user.password = 'password';\n...\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Both the account and password must be explicitly defined if you want the service module to\nrun commands as a specific user. By default, it will run using the user account that launched\nthe process (i.e. who launched <code>node app.js</code>).</p>\n\n<p>The other attribute is <code>sudo</code>. This attribute has a single property called <code>password</code>. By supplying\nthis, the service module will attempt to run commands using the user account that launched the\nprocess and the password for that account. This should only be used for accounts with administrative\nprivileges.</p>\n\n<p><strong>app.js</strong></p>\n\n<pre><code>var Service = require('node-windows').Service;\n\n// Create a new service object\nvar svc = new Service({\n  name:'Hello World',\n  script: require('path').join(__dirname,'helloworld.js')\n});\n\nsvc.sudo.password = 'password';\n...\n</code></pre>\n\n<h2 id='nodeWindowsService-section-3'>Cleaning Up: Uninstall a Service</h2>\n\n<p>Uninstalling a previously created service is syntactically similar to installation.</p>\n\n<pre><code>var Service = require('node-windows').Service;\n\n// Create a new service object\nvar svc = new Service({\n  name:'Hello World',\n  script: require('path').join(__dirname,'helloworld.js')\n});\n\n// Listen for the \"uninstall\" event so we know when it's done.\nsvc.on('uninstall',function(){\n  console.log('Uninstall complete.');\n  console.log('The service exists: ',svc.exists);\n});\n\n// Uninstall the service.\nsvc.uninstall();\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The uninstall process only removes process-specific files. <strong>It does NOT delete your Node.js script!</strong></p>\n\n<h2 id='nodeWindowsService-section-4'>What Makes node-windows Services Unique?</h2>\n\n<p>Lots of things!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Long Running Processes &amp; Monitoring:</strong></p>\n\n<p>The built-in service recovery for Windows services is fairly limited and cannot easily be configured\nfrom code. Therefore, node-windows creates a wrapper around the Node.js script. This wrapper\nis responsible for restarting a failed service in an intelligent and configurable manner. For example,\nif your script crashes due to an unknown error, node-windows will attempt to restart it. By default,\nthis occurs every second. However; if the script has a fatal flaw that makes it crash repeatedly,\nit adds unnecessary overhead to the system. node-windows handles this by increasing the time interval\nbetween restarts and capping the maximum number of restarts.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Smarter Restarts That Won't Pummel Your Server:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Using the default settings, node-windows adds 25% to the wait interval each time it needs to restart\nthe script. With the default setting (1 second), the first restart attempt occurs after one second.\nThe second occurs after 1.25 seconds. The third after 1.56 seconds (1.25 increased by 25%) and so on.\nBoth the initial wait time and the growth rate are configuration options that can be passed to a new\n<code>Service</code>. For example:</p>\n\n<pre><code>var svc = new Service({\n  name:'Hello World',\n  description: 'The nodejs.org example web server.',\n  script: 'C:\\\\path\\\\to\\\\helloworld.js'),\n  wait: 2,\n  grow: .5\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>In this example, the wait period will start at 2 seconds and increase by 50%. So, the second attempt\nwould be 3 seconds later while the fourth would be 4.5 seconds later.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Don't DOS Yourself!</strong></p>\n\n<p>Repetitive recycling could potentially go on forever with a bad script. To handle these situations, node-windows\nsupports two kinds of caps. Using <code>maxRetries</code> will cap the maximum number of restart attempts. By\ndefault, this is unlimited. Setting it to 3 would tell the process to no longer restart a process\nafter it has failed 3 times. Another option is <code>maxRestarts</code>, which caps the number of restarts attempted\nwithin 60 seconds. For example, if this is set to 3 (the default) and the process crashes/restarts repeatedly,\nnode-windows will cease restart attempts after the 3rd cycle in a 60 second window. Both of these\nconfiguration options can be set, just like <code>wait</code> or <code>grow</code>.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, an attribute called <code>abortOnError</code> can be set to <code>true</code> if you want your script to <strong>not</strong> restart\nat all when it exits with an error.</p>\n\n<h2 id='nodeWindowsService-section-5'>How Services Are Made</h2>\n\n<p>node-windows uses the <a href=\"https://github.com/kohsuke/winsw\">winsw</a> utility to create a unique <code>.exe</code>\nfor each Node.js script deployed as a service. A directory called <code>daemon</code> is created and populated\nwith <code>myappname.exe</code> and <code>myappname.xml</code>. The XML file is a configuration for the executable. Additionally,\n<code>winsw</code> will create some logs for itself in this directory (which are viewable in the Event log).</p>\n\n<p>The <code>myappname.exe</code> file launches the node-windows wrapper, which is responsible for monitoring and managing\nthe script. Since this file is a part of node-windows, moving the node-windows directory could result in\nthe <code>.exe</code> file not being able to find the Node.js script. However; this should not be a problem if\nnode-windows is installed globally, per the recommended installation instructions.</p>\n\n<p>All of these daemon-specific files are created in a subdirectory called <code>daemon</code>, which is created in the\nsame directory where the Node.js script is saved. Uninstalling a service will remove these files.</p>\n\n<p><em>Event Logging</em></p>\n\n<p>Services created with node-windows have two event logs that can be viewed through the Windows Event Viewer.\nA log source named <code>myappname.exe</code> provides basic logging for the executable file. It can be used to see\nwhen the entire service starts/stops or has errors. A second log, named after your service name (i.e. My App Name),\nis used by the node-windows monitor. It is possible to write to this log from the Node.js script using\nthe node-windows Event Logging.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<h1>Event Logging</h1>\n\n<p>New as of <code>v0.1.0</code> is a <em>non-C++</em> based event logging utility. This utility can write to the event log,\nmaking your logs visible from the Event Viewer.</p>\n\n<p>To create a logger:</p>\n\n<pre><code>var EventLogger = require('node-windows').EventLogger;\n\nvar log = new EventLogger('Hello World');\n\nlog.info('Basic information.');\nlog.warn('Watch out!');\nlog.error('Something went wrong.');\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Looks similar to:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://raw.github.com/coreybutler/node-windows/master/docs/eventlog.png\" alt=\"Event Logging in node-windows\" /></p>\n\n<p>Some lesser-used options are also available through node-windows event logging.</p>\n\n<pre><code>log.auditSuccess('AUser Login Success');\nlog.auditFailure('AUser Login Failure');\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Each log type (info, warn, error, auditSuccess, and auditFailure) method optionally accepts two additional\narguments, including a <em>code</em> and <em>callback</em>. By default, the event code is <code>1000</code> if not otherwise specified.\nTo provide a custom event code with a log message and write that message to the console, the following code could\nbe used:</p>\n\n<pre><code>log.info('Something different happened!', 1002, function(){\n  console.log('Something different happened!');\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>By default, event logs are all part of the <code>APPLICATION</code> scope. However; it is also possible to use the <code>SYSTEM</code> log.\nTo do this, a configuration object must be passed to the new log:</p>\n\n<pre><code>var EventLogger = require('node-windows').EventLogger;\nvar log = new EventLogger({\n  source: 'My Event Log',\n  eventLog: 'SYSTEM'\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<h1>Licenses</h1>\n\n<p>winsw and sudowin are the copyrights of their respective owners. winsw\nis distributed under an MIT license. sudowin is distributed under a BSD license.</p>\n\n<p>All other scripts are Copyright (c) Corey Butler under an MIT license.</p>\n\n<p>(The MIT License)</p>\n\n<p>Copyright (c) 2013 Corey Butler</p>\n\n<p>Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\nthe following conditions:</p>\n\n<p>The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.</p>\n\n<p>THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.\nIN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY\nCLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,\nTORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE\nSOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.</p>\n","title":"Services"});
