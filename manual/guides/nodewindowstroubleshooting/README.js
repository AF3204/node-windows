In some circumstances, primarily during _un_installation, it is\npossbile for the process to temporarily lock a log file, which prevents Windows\nfrom removing it. In this scenario, simply run the uninstall again. In most cases this\nwill fix the issue. If not, manually remove the <code>daemon</code> directory before running the\ninstallation again.</p>\n\n<h2 id='nodewindowstroubleshooting-section-1'>Node-Windows Tests</h2>\n\n<p>node-windows uses several command line scripts to execute processes and bypass the need\nfor native modules. Additionally, node-windows attempts to handle account permissions, but\ntests will still fail if they are not run with the appropriate account credentials. Therefore,\nit is hard to decipher whether an issue stems from a user account, credentials, elevated permmissions,\nor the code itself.</p>\n\n<p>In a <em>best effort</em> fashion, the examples are rudimentary. They have been tested and are known\nto work. If you experience problems with the module, it is best to try running the examples first to\nverify basic functionality.</p>\n\n<h2 id='nodewindowstroubleshooting-section-2'>Testing Services</h2>\n\n<p>node-windows ships with a service/daemon management tool. It is important to note that installing\nand uninstalling processes, which use <code>winsw.exe</code>, can take some time to complete. In particular,\nthere is a problem if you attempt to uninstall a process before it has completed installation.\nWindows locks a log file while installing the process, which cannot be removed until the installation\nis complete.</p>\n\n<h2 id='nodewindowstroubleshooting-section-3'>Other Issue?</h2>\n\n<p>If you are having other issues, please post them in the <a href=\"https://github.com/coreybutler/node-windows/issues\">bug tracker</a>.</p>\n","title":"Troubleshooting"});
